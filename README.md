### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Nickolas
#### I am a Junior Data Engineer, with cloud hands-on experience, followed by an academic journey in Machine Learning & Big Data.
I possess a hands-on foundation in AWS services (Lambda, S3, Glue, Athena, etc.) and utilize Python, SQL, Docker, and Git to design, implement, and maintain ETL workflows.  I'm constantly seeking opportunities to expand my skillset and delve deeper into the world of data engineering.

Here's a glimpse of what I've accomplished:

**Serverless AWS Data Engineering Project:** Successfully built a serverless data pipeline using AWS services to ingest, transform, and visualize real-time weather data. This project involved leveraging Lambda functions, Kinesis Firehose for streaming data, Glue ETL Workflows for data transformation, Athena for querying transformed data, and Grafana Cloud for data visualization.
**Data Analytics Project with AWS:** Utilized S3 and AWS QuickSight to analyze historical data on Netflix movies and TV shows. I leveraged a JSON manifest to configure QuickSight and perform insightful data exploration.
**MSc Thesis on Predictive Fairness in Healthcare:** My Master's thesis explored the potential for bias in machine learning models used for patient readmission prediction in healthcare. Through this research, I developed a framework for identifying and mitigating bias in these models, emphasizing the importance of data engineering techniques and explainable AI tools in achieving fair and accurate predictions.

Skills: Python | ETL | SQL | AWS (Kinesis Firehose, Lambda, S3, Athena, EventBridge, Glue ETL Workflow, Glue Crawler | QuickSight) | Git | Machine Learning | Linux

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on hands-on AWS projects to gain experience in cloud engineering. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning PySpark and SparkSQL on real-life practice examples. In the meantime, I am getting more experience in Docker, considering it vital to master for my career path. 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Open to working on projects that involve building and deploying machine learning pipelines on the cloud. My skills in both cloud and ML can be a valuable asset.
