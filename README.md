### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Nickolas!
#### As a Junior Data Engineer, I'm skilled in building data pipelines (Airflow, dbt, Soda) that ensure data quality and empower data exploration (Metabase, Looker, Grafana).
#### Leveraging my proficiency in Python, SQL, Docker, and Git, I actively design, implement, and maintain robust ETL workflows across cloud platforms.

Here's a breakdown of my cloud skills:

**AWS:** I effectively manage data ingestion using Kinesis Firehose for real-time streaming and Lambda functions for serverless processing. For storage and management, I utilize S3 and Glue for data crawling based on their partitions. Glue also offers ETL workflow orchestration for building scalable data pipelines, including ETL Job scripts and triggers. Finally, I can query transformed data with Athena and create interactive visualizations with QuickSight, or with Grafana Cloud connected to Athena, utilizing SQL queries.

**GCP:** My experience extends to BigQuery and Looker, allowing me to work with scalable data storage, analytics, and data visualization within the GCP ecosystem.

And now a glimpse of what I've accomplished:

**Serverless AWS Data Engineering Project:** In this project, I built a serverless data pipeline using AWS services to ingest, transform, and visualize real-time weather data. This project involved leveraging Lambda functions, Kinesis Firehose for streaming data, Glue ETL Workflows for orchestrating the data pipeline by connecting the Glue Crawler, ETL jobs alongside with triggers, Athena for querying transformed data, and Grafana Cloud for interactive data visualization.

**Data Analytics AWS QuickSight Project:** In this project, I utilized S3 and AWS QuickSight to analyze historical data on Netflix movies and TV shows. I leveraged a JSON manifest to configure QuickSight and perform insightful data exploration.

**DBT, GCP BigQuery, Looker Data Engineering Project**: In this project, I explored dbt and BigQuery to construct a data transformation pipeline. dbt's SQL-based approach offered a familiar language for data manipulation, streamlining the process. I wrote and tested SQL-based transformations (models) within dbt. These models executed directly in BigQuery, transforming raw data into a usable format. The transformed data resided in BigQuery. This ensured efficient storage and retrieval of large datasets. Finally, I connected Looker Studio to the BigQuery instance, enabling interactive data visualization through drag-and-drop actions to explore the transformed data.

**Data Pipeline for Automated Report Quality & Visualization Project (Airflow, dbt, BigQuery, Metabase)**: This project automates report quality checks and data visualizations using a powerful tech stack. Airflow orchestrated the execution of data quality checks written in YAML files. These checks were powered by Soda, a framework specifically designed for data validation. dbt seamlessly integrated with Airflow using Cosmos/Astro, an extension that allowed automatic execution of dbt models within Airflow workflows. This streamlined data transformation for analysis in BigQuery, the project's data warehouse. For data management, the pipeline leveraged the Astro SDK and its Load File Operator. This operator simplified loading data into BigQuery, ensuring efficient data storage. Python virtual environments and the Python Operator within Airflow provided flexibility for running custom Python code within the pipeline. This allowed for handling unique situations and adding custom logic. This approach streamlined the process, ensured data accuracy through Soda checks, and empowered clear data insights with dbt and Metabase visualizations.

**MSc Thesis on Predictive Fairness in Healthcare:** My Master's thesis explored the potential for bias in machine learning models used for patient readmission prediction in healthcare. Through this research, I developed a framework for identifying and mitigating bias in these models, emphasizing the importance of data engineering techniques and explainable AI tools in achieving fair and accurate predictions. The focus of this project is on utilizing xAI techniques and Fair AI Libraries for Machine Learning Bias Management across its life cycle.
