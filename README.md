### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Nickolas!

#### Operations | Data Analyst
I am an Operations and Data Analyst specialising in the supply chain and operations sectors, with a background in Shipping Logistics Analytics and a recent MSc in Technology and Operations Management (Specialised on Data-Driven Solutions and Machine Learning). I bring a strong foundation in supply chain, operations management, and a passion in Data.
From designing interactive dashboards with KPIs to performing advanced analytics projects in cloud platforms, I focus on crafting data-driven strategies that empower organizations to make informed decisions, ensuring scalable and impactful solutions for operational and supply chain challenges. My expertise spans the entire data lifecycle, from data collection and cleaning, ETL practices, to predictive modeling.
I am currently seeking opportunities to apply my analytical skills and technical expertise in roles that bridge operations, supply chain, and data analytics. My goal is to contribute to organizations that value innovation, efficiency, and data-driven transformation, helping them achieve operational excellence and sustainable growth.
#### History of effective cloud-native engineering projects, utilization of DevOps tools for version control and dockerization, practice in ETL & data manipulation tools. Recent MSc graduate focusing on big data and ML operations.

Have a look at my end-to-end data analytics - engineering projects:



**MSc Thesis on Predictive Fairness in Healthcare:** My Master's thesis explored the potential for bias in machine learning models used for patient readmission prediction in healthcare. Through this research, I developed a framework for identifying and mitigating bias in these models, emphasizing the importance of data engineering techniques and explainable AI tools in achieving fair and accurate predictions. The focus of this project is on utilizing xAI techniques and Fair AI Libraries for Machine Learning Bias Management across its life cycle.
